# Steam-for-Nintendo-Switch-
FINALLY!!! I was able to use OpenAI's GPT 4o to code an entire script, which can be used on a Jailbroken Nintendo Switch Running Ubuntu 24.04+ (Noble) to play steam games (Locally!) . The goal was to make a simple copy/paste command that installed Wine, Box64, Box86, DXVK and Steam on Linux to run games without streaming!!!
