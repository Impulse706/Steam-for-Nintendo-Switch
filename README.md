# Steam-for-Nintendo-Switch-
FINALLY!!! I was able to use OpenAI's GPT 4o to code an entire script, which can be used on a Jailbroken Nintendo Switch Running Ubuntu 24.04+ (Noble) to play steam games (Locally!) . The goal was to make a simple copy/paste command that installed Wine, Box64, Box86, DXVK and Steam on Linux to run games without streaming!!! This project is still under development, so please take everything seriously. What you do is what you're responsible for, by downloading anything, you claim responsibility for whatever happens.

GUIDE

1. Once you have downloaded the .DOCX file, copy and paste the entire script to a new notepad.
2. Drag and drop the saved notepad file onto a USB drive.
3. Plug in the USB into your Switch.
4. Open the notepad file, and copy the contents.
5. Open a new terminal window (Any terminal works fine) Paste the code, hit enter, then when prompted, enter sudo password.
6. Wait for the script to run and finish, then Steam will launch with Box and Wine.
7. Play some games! Congrats it's done!!
